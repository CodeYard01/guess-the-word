# How to Play:

  The game will present you with underscores representing each letter of the randomly chosen word.

  You have to guess a letter by entering it through the keyboard.

  If your guessed letter is correct, it will be revealed in the word. If it's incorrect, a part of the hangman will be drawn.

  You win if you successfully guess the word before the hangman is fully drawn. Otherwise, you lose.
